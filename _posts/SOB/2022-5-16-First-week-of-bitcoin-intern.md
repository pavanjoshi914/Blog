Voila, readers ðŸ‘‹! It's been a week since I started my Journey with Bitcoin as a Bitcoin Intern and it has been a great learning experience so far.

During the First Week of the Bitcoin Internship, I got the opportunity to meet many tech Bitcoin experts worldwide. We took a deep dive into the Bitcoin protocol and how we can enhance career opportunities through this intern.

We got to hold a welcome session conducted by Summer of Bitcoin Admin **Adi Shankara**. During this session, we learned about different initial tasks we have to get started with (TODOs), Stats of Summer of Bitcoin 2022, Expectations of the program from its selected interns and many different perks and opportunities this intern provides.

For this year, out of 20k applications worldwide, only 82 interns from 15 different countries were selected, making it into Summer of Bitcoin in the first attempt and being a part of those 82 interns makes me feel overwhelmed.
