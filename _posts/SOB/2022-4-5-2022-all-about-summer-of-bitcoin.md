## What is Summer of Bitcoin? ü§î

## Summer Of Bitcoin Journey ‚¨áÔ∏è
 
After completing my Google Summer of Code 2021, I become more enthusiastic for working on challenging codebases and solving harder problems. One of my friend introduced me to Summer of Bitcoin.

Initially, I had no prior experience in blockchain and working of Bitcoin. I was able to crack **screening round** through my coding skills and elevated myself in the direction of Bitcoin and Blockchain by learning more about it.

During this time, I got to meet many different Bitcoin contributors from different parts of the world. It really excited me to give my best in this direction.

## Project Details üìë 

I will be working on making Bitcoin payments transactions smart with structured metadata with Alby Community. This is possible by extending the latest technologies such as **WebLN** and **LNURL** which are being build on top of the **Bitcoin and Lightning Network**.

The aim of this project is to extend existing standards such as Webln and lnurl to enrich transactions with additional information as structured metadata so that transactions containing static data contain more meaningful information giving more interactivity to the transactions.

 
### Objectives üíª
   
* Research different use cases which supports the concept of making transactions smarter with structured metadata.
* Markup metadata so that it is structured and properly organized using specifications such as schema.org.
* Writing specifications for extending standards such as Webln on client-side as well as Alby wallet side.
* Implementation of the specifications in Alby.
* Different prototypes demonstrating use cases.

For more, stay connected!!!
