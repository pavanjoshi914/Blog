At 6pm UTC i.e. (11:30 pm in _**India**_), I recieved a mail from Google :airplane: about my _**proposal**_ that it has been accepted for **_Google Summer of Code 2021_** and I am going to be a part of it:tada: :tada:.
 
Yay!! :stars: I made into _**GSoC**_ in my very first attempt at an early phase of my graduation. Being a _**sophomore**_, I took this as a career elevating opportunity and a platform for _**great learning experience**_ along with exposure to the _**real coding world**_.

In this post, I will be discussing what exactly GSoC is and how Open Source industry along with GSoC are helping students and engineers throughout world to bring out their true potential.

## About GSOC and OPEN SOURCE

><h2>Open Source is "You are welcome to make our software better!"</h2>
 
Do you know, according to Wikipedia more than _**180,000**_ Open Source Projects _**(Softwares)**_ are already serving people throughout the world, thus Open Source Culture has yielded a tremendous growth in the Software Industry.
 
Yes!! Open Source welcomes all _**Developers**_, _**Undergraduate Students**_ and _**Engineers**_ to elevate their skills and gain a professional level software development experience in terms of _**contribution**_ to the Open Source Software, _**documentation**_ and anything that you can serve to make an _**Open Source Software**_ better.
 
Recently, open source community has helped a very important mission known as _**[NASAâ€™s Ingenuity Helicopter](https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)**_ :helicopter:. This Ingenuityâ€™s software used by NASA's _**First Mars Helicopter**_ were empowered by nearly 12,000 developers from all around the world via Open Source.
 
## What is Google Summer of Code ?
 
The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated as GSoC, is an _**International Annual Program**_ in which Google awards _**stipends**_ to students who successfully complete, a free and open-source software _**coding project**_ during summer. This program is open to university students aged 18 and more.
 
GSoC is an _**initiative**_ to serve open source culture and is administered by Google _**Main Headquarters**_ since 2005. As of now, 16,000+ students from 111 countries worked with 715 open source organizations, serving 38,000,000+ lines of code to the world through major open source applications and softwares.
 
GSoC is a <b>competitive program :computer:</b> in which students apply to mentoring organizations and compete with other aspirants for their selection. The one who represents best possible _**coding skills**_ and the _**proposal**_ to achieve a particular project gets selected.
 
Selection criteria in GSoC not only depends on proposal and application of the student, but also on your _**past experience**_, _**previous contributions to mentoring organizations**_ and many more...
 
>Students who complete GSoC successfully get a handsome amount of <b>$1500 dollars</b> :dollar: as a stipend and _**Certification of Success**_ from _**Google**_ :boom:.
 
As GSoC is a global program:

In 2021, Students from 103 countries applied for the GSoC, from which 1292 students were selected from 69 countries.
 
GSoC not only elevates your career opportunities as a student but also have the following key benefits -

* Get to learn about the working of a software industry by working on software codebases :dizzy:.
* Improve coding skills, soft skills and build your network with engineers, mentors and open source contributors :sparkles:.
* More exposure to internship and job based opportunities :airplane:.
* Handsome amount of $1500 dollars as a stipend ðŸ¤©.
* Build a strong resume along with certification of success from Google :stars:.
* Tag of being a GSoC student ðŸ˜Ž.

## My selection in GSoC
 
I started contributing to open source, during the second semester of my B.Tech graduation. I picked an _**organization**_ named _**CircuitVerse**_ to begin my journey with open source.
 
During this time, I linked up with engineers and team members of CircuitVerse and _**learnt**_ a lot of new things by _**collaborating with mentors**_ of the organization. I applied to GSoC as a sophomore and was accepted into _**GSoC'2021 at CircuitVerse**_ :tada:.
 
I will be working on _**Internationalization (I18n)**_ of all CircuitVerse platforms and will be gaining work experience with varieties of technologies such as _**Rails**_, _**JavaScript**_, _**Flutter**_, _**Jekyll DocsifyJs**_ etc.

## More about mentoring organization
  

> [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org) is a _**digital circuit simulation platform**_ which offers easy to use tools for creating, sharing and learning digital logic circuits.
 
Along with CircuitVerse main platform (written in Rails). Community also maintains -

- Simulator (In JavaScript) - For digital circuit simulation
- Interactive Book (In Jekyll) - for learning more about Digital Circuits
- Mobile App (In flutter) - Providing interface for mobile users
- CircuitVerse Desktop App (in electron) - Providing offline interface for desktop users
 
Go ahead!! start your Open Source journey with [CircuitVerse](https://github.com/CircuitVerse)!
