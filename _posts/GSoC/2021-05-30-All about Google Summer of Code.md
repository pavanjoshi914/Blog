At 6pm UTC (11:30 pm - India), I got an email from Google :airplane: that my proposal has been accepted and I will be a part of Google Summer of Code 2021 :tada: :tada:.
 
Yay!! :stars: I made it into GSoC in my very first attempt and in very early phase of my graduation. Being a sophomore, I take this as a career elevating opportunity and a platform for great learning experience along with exposure to the real coding world.

In this post, I will be discussing what exactly GSoC is and how the open source industry along with GSoC is helping students and engineers in bringing out their true potential.
 
## About GSoC and Open Source
### Open Source is "You are welcome to make our software better!"
 
You know, According to wikipedia 180,000 open source projects (Softwares) are already serving people all around the world, thus open source culture has yielded a tremendous growth in the software industry.
 
yes!! open source welcomes developers, undergraduate students and engineers to elevate their skills and gain professional level software development experience in terms of contribution to the open source software, documentation and anything you can serve to make an open source software better.
 
Recently open source community helped in very important mission known as [NASAâ€™s Ingenuity Helicopter](https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter) :helicopter:. The Ingenuityâ€™s software used for NASA's <b>First Mars Helicopter</b> were empowered by nearly 12,000 developers from all around the world via Open Source.
 
### What is Google Summer of Code ?
 
The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over.
 
GSoC is the initiative to serve open source culture and is administered by Google Main Headquarters since 2005. As of now,  16,000+ students from 111 countries worked with 715 open source organizations, serving 38,000,000+ lines of code to the world through major open source applications and softwares.
 
GSoC is a <b>competitive program :computer:</b> in which students apply to mentoring organizations and compete with other aspirants for their selection. Best coders and who provides the best proposal to achieve a particular project gets selected.
 
Selection criteria in GSoC not only depends on proposal and application of the student, but also past experience, previous contributions to mentoring organizations and many more.
 
Students who complete GSoC successfully get a handsome amount of <b>$1500 dollars</b> :dollar: as a stipend and a </b>certification of success</b> from Google :boom:.
 
As GSoC is a global program, in 2021 Students from <b>103</b> countries applied for the GSoC from which <b>1292</b> students were selected from <b>69</b> countries.
 
GSoC not only elevates your career opportunities as a student but also have following key benefits -

* get to learn about the working of a software industry by working on software codebases :dizzy:.
* Improve coding skills, soft skills and build your network with engineers, mentors and open source contributors :sparkles:.
* More exposure to internship based and job based opportunities :airplane:.
* Handsome amount of $1500 dollars as a stipend ðŸ¤©.
* Build a strong resume along with certification of success from Google :stars:.
* Tag of being a GSoC student ðŸ˜Ž.
 
## My selection in GSoC 
 
I started Open Source contribution during the second semester of my B.Tech graduation. I picked an organization named CircuitVerse to begin my journey with open source.
 
During this I met engineers and team members of CircuitVerse and learnt a lot of new things by collaborating with mentors of the organization. I applied to GSoC as a sophomore and was accepted into GSoC'2021 at CircuitVerse :tada:.
 
I will be working on Internationalization (I18n) of all CircuitVerse platforms and will be gaining work experience with varieties of technologies such as Rails, JavaScript, Flutter, Jekyll DocsifyJs etc.

## More about mentoring organization

[CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org) is a digital circuit simulation platform which offers easy to use tools for creating, sharing and learning digital logic circuits.
 
Along with CircuitVerse main platform (written in Rails). community also maintains -

- Simulator (In JavaScript) - For digital circuit simulation
- Interactive Book (In Jekyll) - for learning more about Digital Circuits
- Mobile App (In flutter) - Providing interface for mobile users
- CircuitVerse Desktop App (in electron) - Providing offline interface for desktop users
 
Go ahead!! start your Open Source journey with [CircuitVerse](https://github.com/CircuitVerse)!
