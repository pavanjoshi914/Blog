Currently, I am in the 5th week of the coding period before GSoC phase one evaluations. During this week, I had a relaxing time, as major commits done for phase one evaluations were already completed.

We had a slight change in the timeline for this week. Instead of working on ```Docsify.js``` framework, I started working with Simulator and Mobile App. Along with this, I had to focus on preparing my code for Phase one evaluations.

#### Week 5: Starting work on Simulator and Mobile App

Major portions of Ruby code was already covered and consequently, I started working on Simulator and Mobile App.

Following tasks were achieved during this week ‚è¨ :-

* Start localizing JavaScript-based Simulator Code.
* Design Language Switcher and I18n test Suite for Rails.
* Start of initial work in Mobile App.
* Working on I18n documentation

&nbsp;

Waiting for the results of phase one evaluations ahead!!!

For more, stay connected!!

Best Regards ~ Pavan
